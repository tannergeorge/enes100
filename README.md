Programming an autonomous overterrain vehicle for ENES100 (Intro to Engineering Design).
The vehicle navigates to a randomly-placed mission site from a random position and orientation. Once at the mission site, it extracts a puck from a pylon, determines its magnetic quality, and reads a duty cycle coming from the pylon. Afterwards, it navigates a series of three randomly-placed obstacles and over log to reach the finish zone.
